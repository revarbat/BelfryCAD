# Grid-Ruler Alignment Fix - Final Resolution

## Problem Resolved
The user reported that grid lines were "even more misaligned with the ruler ticks" after the initial alignment fix attempt. The issue was traced to a fundamental difference between the grid drawing algorithm and the ruler tick calculation algorithm.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Issue
The DrawingManager's `_draw_grid_lines()` method used an incorrect algorithm for placing major grid lines:

**Incorrect Algorithm (causing misalignment):**
```python
# Major grid lines - WRONG approach
x = math.ceil(xstart / majorspacing) * majorspacing
while x <= xend:
    x_scene = x * scalemult
    # Draw line at x_scene
    x += majorspacing  # Iterate by major spacing
```

**Correct Algorithm (matching rulers):**
```python
# Major grid lines - CORRECT approach (matching rulers)
x = math.floor(xstart / minorspacing + 1e-6) * minorspacing
while x <= xend:
    # Check if this position should have a major tick
    if abs(math.floor(x / labelspacing + 1e-6) - x / labelspacing) < 1e-3:
        x_scene = x * scalemult
        # Draw line at x_scene
    x += minorspacing  # Iterate by minor spacing, not major
```

### Key Differences
1. **Starting position calculation**: 
   - Wrong: `math.ceil(xstart / majorspacing) * majorspacing`
   - Right: `math.floor(xstart / minorspacing + 1e-6) * minorspacing`

2. **Iteration step**:
   - Wrong: `x += majorspacing` (skip to next major position)
   - Right: `x += minorspacing` (check every minor position for major tick)

3. **Selection criteria**:
   - Wrong: Draw at every major spacing interval
   - Right: Draw only where ruler would place a major tick (using labelspacing)

### Why Tests Initially Passed
The test scripts were calculating expected positions using the **correct ruler algorithm**, not the **incorrect DrawingManager algorithm**. This created a false sense of alignment in testing while the actual grid remained misaligned.

## Solution Implementation

### Modified DrawingManager._draw_grid_lines()
**File:** `/BelfryCAD/gui/drawing_manager.py`

1. **Updated method signature** to include `labelspacing` parameter:
```python
def _draw_grid_lines(self, xstart, xend, ystart, yend, minorspacing,
                     majorspacing, superspacing, labelspacing, scalemult,
                     gridcolor, unitcolor, supercolor, linewidth,
                     srx0, srx1, sry0, sry1):
```

2. **Updated method call** to pass `labelspacing`:
```python
self._draw_grid_lines(xstart, xend, ystart, yend, minorspacing,
                      majorspacing, superspacing, labelspacing,
                      scalemult, gridcolor, unitcolor, 
                      supercolor, lwidth, srx0, srx1, sry0, sry1)
```

3. **Replaced major grid line algorithm** with ruler-compatible logic:
   - Use `math.floor(xstart / minorspacing + 1e-6) * minorspacing` for starting position
   - Iterate by `minorspacing` instead of `majorspacing`
   - Check `labelspacing` alignment condition before drawing each line
