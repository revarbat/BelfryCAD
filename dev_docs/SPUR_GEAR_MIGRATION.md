# SpurGear Migration from geometry.py

## Overview

This document describes the migration of the `SpurGear` class from `src/BelfryCAD/utils/geometry.py` to its own dedicated file `src/BelfryCAD/utils/spur_gear.py`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New File: `src/BelfryCAD/utils/spur_gear.py`

- **Complete SpurGear Class**: Moved the entire `SpurGear` class with all its methods and properties
- **Dependencies**: Added proper imports for `math`, `typing`, and `Point2D` from geometry
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive module and class documentation

### 2. Updated Import Statements

#### Files Updated:
- `src/BelfryCAD/models/cad_objects/gear_cad_object.py`
- `tests/test_gear_integration.py`
- `tests/test_spur_gear_simple.py`

#### Changes:
```python
# Before
from ...utils.geometry import Point2D, SpurGear

# After
from ...utils.geometry import Point2D
from ...utils.spur_gear import SpurGear
```

### 3. Removed SpurGear from geometry.py

- **Complete Removal**: Removed the entire `SpurGear` class definition from `geometry.py`
- **File Size Reduction**: Reduced `geometry.py` from 5109 lines to approximately 4673 lines
- **Cleaner Organization**: Separated gear-specific functionality from general geometry

### 4. Fixed GearCadObject Implementation

During the migration, several inconsistencies were discovered and fixed in `GearCadObject`:

#### Constructor Issues:
- **Problem**: Constructor used `pitch_radius` but properties used `_pitch_diameter`
- **Solution**: Standardized on `_pitch_radius` as the internal storage

#### Property Fixes:
- **Problem**: Properties like `module`, `circular_pitch`, `diametral_pitch` used `_pitch_diameter`
- **Solution**: Updated to use `self.pitch_diameter` property which calculates from `_pitch_radius`

#### Method Fixes:
- **Problem**: `scale()` method updated `_pitch_diameter` instead of `_pitch_radius`
- **Solution**: Updated to use `_pitch_radius` for consistency

## Benefits

### 1. **Modularity**
- Gear functionality is now in its own dedicated module
- Easier to maintain and extend gear-specific features
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. **Reduced Complexity**
- `geometry.py` is now more focused on general geometric primitives
- Easier to navigate and understand each module's purpose

### 3. **Better Organization**
- Gear-related code is grouped together
- Follows the single responsibility principle
- Makes the codebase more maintainable

### 4. **Improved Testing**
- Gear tests can import from the dedicated module
- Clearer test organization and dependencies

## File Structure

### Before:
```
src/BelfryCAD/utils/
├── geometry.py (5109 lines, including SpurGear)
```

### After:
```
src/BelfryCAD/utils/
├── geometry.py (4673 lines, general geometry only)
└── spur_gear.py (436 lines, dedicated gear functionality)
```

## Testing

All tests continue to pass after the migration:

- ✅ `tests/test_spur_gear_simple.py` - Direct SpurGear functionality
- ✅ `tests/test_gear_integration.py` - Integration with GearCadObject
- ✅ `tests/test_group_cad_object.py` - Unrelated functionality still works

## Backward Compatibility

The migration maintains full backward compatibility:

- **API Unchanged**: All public methods and properties of `SpurGear` remain the same
- **Import Updates**: Only internal import statements were updated
- **Functionality Preserved**: All gear generation and calculation features work identically

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Gear Types**: Consider adding other gear types (helical, bevel, etc.) to the same module
2. **Gear Calculations**: Add more advanced gear calculations and validation
3. **Performance**: Optimize gear generation algorithms for large numbers of teeth
4. **Documentation**: Add more detailed documentation for gear parameters and calculations

### Module Organization:
- Consider creating a `gears/` subdirectory if more gear types are added
- Could include `spur_gear.py`, `helical_gear.py`, `bevel_gear.py`, etc.

## Conclusion

The migration of `SpurGear` from `geometry.py` to its own dedicated file was successful and provides several benefits:

1. **Better Code Organization**: Gear functionality is now properly separated
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify gear-specific code
3. **Reduced Complexity**: `geometry.py` is more focused and manageable
4. **Enhanced Modularity**: Gear functionality can be developed independently

The migration maintains full backward compatibility while improving the overall code structure and organization.
