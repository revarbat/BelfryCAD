# Zoom-to-Fit on Document Load Implementation

## Overview
Implemented automatic zoom-to-fit functionality that activates after loading a document file. This ensures that when a document is opened, the view automatically adjusts to show all objects in the scene with optimal zoom and centering.

## Problem
Previously, when opening a document file, the view would remain at the default zoom level and position, which could result in:
- Objects being too small to see clearly
- Objects being positioned outside the visible area
- Users having to manually zoom and pan to find the content
- Inconsistent viewing experience between different documents

## Solution
Added automatic zoom-to-fit functionality that activates immediately after loading and displaying document content.

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes
**File**: `src/BelfryCAD/gui/document_window.py`

**Location**: `load_belcad_file()` method

**Change Made**:
```python
# Build viewmodels and views
self._build_viewmodels_for_document()
# Zoom to fit the loaded document
self._zoom_to_fit()
# Update title
self.update_title()
```

### Existing Infrastructure Used
The implementation leverages the existing `_zoom_to_fit()` method which was already implemented for the View menu's "Zoom to Fit" functionality.

**Existing `_zoom_to_fit()` Method Features**:
- Calculates bounding rectangle of all scene items (excluding grid and rulers)
- Adds appropriate padding (5% of bounding rect size)
- Uses `QGraphicsView.fitInView()` with aspect ratio preservation
- Updates zoom widget display with new zoom level
- Handles empty scenes gracefully (resets to 100% zoom at origin)

### Integration Points

1. **Document Loading Flow**:
   ```
   Load Document → Build ViewModels → Zoom to Fit → Update Title
   ```

2. **Supported File Formats**:
   - `.belcad` (compressed)
   - `.belcadx` (uncompressed XML)
   - Any format handled by `load_belcad_file()`

3. **Scene Item Filtering**:
   - Includes all CAD objects (lines, circles, arcs, etc.)
   - Excludes grid background and rulers
   - Excludes UI elements like snap cursor

## Behavior Description

### Automatic Activation
- Triggers automatically after successful document load
- Executes after all viewmodels and views are created
- No user interaction required

### Zoom Calculation
- Calculates optimal zoom to fit all objects in view
- Maintains aspect ratio to prevent distortion
- Adds 5% padding around content for visual breathing room
- Respects zoom limits defined in the zoom system

### Empty Document Handling
- If no objects exist, resets to 100% zoom at origin
- Provides consistent starting point for new content

### View Centering
- Automatically centers the view on the content
- Eliminates need for manual panning to find objects

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Immediate Content Visibility**: All objects are immediately visible when opening a document
2. **Optimal Zoom Level**: Content is automatically sized appropriately for the viewport
3. **Consistent Experience**: Same behavior regardless of document content or size
4. **Reduced Manual Work**: No need to manually zoom and pan after opening files
5. **Better First Impression**: Documents open with professional, optimized view

### For Workflow
1. **Faster Review**: Immediate overview of document content
2. **Better Orientation**: Clear understanding of document scale and layout
3. **Improved Productivity**: Less time spent adjusting view settings
4. **Professional Presentation**: Documents always open with optimal appearance

## Technical Details

### Performance Impact
- Minimal performance impact as it reuses existing zoom infrastructure
- Single calculation after document load (not continuous)
- Efficient bounding rectangle calculation using Qt's built-in methods

### Compatibility
- Works with all existing document formats
- Compatible with existing zoom system and menu commands
- Maintains existing keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+0 for manual zoom-to-fit)

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handles empty documents
- Falls back to default zoom if calculation fails
- Does not affect document loading success/failure

## Testing

### Test Scenarios Verified
1. **Small Documents**: Single object files zoom appropriately
2. **Large Documents**: Multi-object files with wide distribution fit correctly
3. **Empty Documents**: New/empty files reset to standard view
4. **Various Formats**: Both `.belcad` and `.belcadx` files work correctly
5. **Recent Files**: Opening from recent files menu triggers zoom-to-fit

### Expected Results
- All CAD objects are visible in the viewport
- Appropriate zoom level is set (neither too close nor too far)
- View is centered on the content
- Zoom widget displays correct percentage

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **User Preference**: Option to enable/disable auto zoom-to-fit
2. **Zoom Limits**: Configurable minimum/maximum zoom levels for auto-fit
3. **Smart Padding**: Dynamic padding based on object types or complexity
4. **Animation**: Smooth transition to fit view instead of instant jump

### Integration Opportunities
1. **New Document**: Could extend to new document creation
2. **Import Operations**: Apply to imported geometry
3. **Paste Operations**: Auto-fit when pasting large content

## Conclusion
The zoom-to-fit on load implementation provides an immediate improvement to user experience by ensuring documents always open with optimal viewing settings. The implementation is lightweight, reliable, and builds on existing infrastructure while maintaining compatibility with all current functionality.
