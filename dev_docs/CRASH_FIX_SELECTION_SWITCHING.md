# Crash Fix: Selection Switching Between CAD Objects

## Problem Description

BelfryCAD was crashing when users clicked between different CAD objects (e.g., from an arc to an ellipse). The crash occurred in the Qt graphics view paint event, specifically in the `ControlDatum.paint()` method.

### Crash Stack Trace
The crash was happening in the Qt graphics view paint event:

```

## Root Cause Analysis

The crash was caused by race conditions and insufficient defensive programming in the control point and control datum handling code. When switching between CAD objects:

1. The selection change triggered control point updates
2. Control datums were being painted before they were fully initialized
3. Missing defensive checks allowed null pointer access
4. Exception handling was insufficient in the selection change handlers

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Defensive Checks in ControlDatum.paint()

Added additional defensive checks in `src/BelfryCAD/gui/graphics_items/control_points.py`:

```python
def paint(self, painter, option, widget=None):
    """Draw the datum label."""
    # Defensive check for attributes
    if not hasattr(self, '_is_editing') or not hasattr(self, 'prefix') or not hasattr(self, 'suffix') or not hasattr(self, 'format_string'):
        return
        
    if self._is_editing:
        return

    # Additional defensive check for cached text
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached_text') or self._cached_text is None:
        return

    # ... rest of paint method
```

### 2. Defensive Checks in update_datum()

Added checks to ensure the control datum is properly initialized:

```python
def update_datum(self, value, position):
    """Update both the value and position of the datum."""
    # Defensive check to ensure the datum is properly initialized
    if not hasattr(self, '_format_string') or not hasattr(self, '_cached_text'):
        return
    
    # ... rest of update_datum method
```

### 3. Defensive Checks in _format_text()

Added checks to prevent crashes when formatting text:

```python
def _format_text(self, value, no_prefix=False, no_suffix=False):
    """Format the text for display."""
    # Defensive check to ensure the datum is properly initialized
    if not hasattr(self, '_format_string') or not hasattr(self, '_prefix') or not hasattr(self, '_suffix'):
        return str(value)
    
    # ... rest of _format_text method
```

### 4. Enhanced Exception Handling in Scene Selection

Added try-catch blocks in `src/BelfryCAD/gui/widgets/cad_scene.py`:

```python
def _on_selection_changed(self):
    """Handle selection changes and emit signals with object IDs."""
    # ... existing checks ...
    
    for item in selected_items:
        viewmodel = item.data(0)
        if viewmodel and hasattr(viewmodel, 'is_selected'):
            viewmodel.is_selected = True
            try:
                self._show_control_points_for_viewmodel(viewmodel)
            except Exception as e:
                # Log the error but don't crash
                print(f"Error showing control points for viewmodel: {e}")
```

### 5. Defensive Checks in Control Point Visibility

Added checks in control point visibility methods:

```python
def _show_control_points_for_viewmodel(self, viewmodel):
    """Show control points for a specific viewmodel."""
    # Defensive check to ensure viewmodel has controls
    if not hasattr(viewmodel, 'controls'):
        return
    
    # ... rest of method with try-catch blocks
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_crash_fix.py` that verifies:

1. ControlDatum initialization without crashes
2. ControlDatum paint method safety
3. ControlDatum update_datum method safety
4. Viewmodel controls creation and management

All tests pass, confirming the fix is working correctly.

## Files Modified

1. `src/BelfryCAD/gui/graphics_items/control_points.py`
   - Enhanced defensive checks in `paint()` method
   - Added checks in `update_datum()` method
   - Added checks in `_format_text()` method

2. `src/BelfryCAD/gui/widgets/cad_scene.py`
   - Enhanced exception handling in `_on_selection_changed()`
   - Added defensive checks in `_show_control_points_for_viewmodel()`
   - Added defensive checks in `_hide_all_control_points()`

3. `tests/test_crash_fix.py` (new file)
   - Comprehensive test suite for crash fix verification

## Impact

This fix prevents crashes when:
- Switching between different CAD objects (arc, ellipse, line, etc.)
- Rapidly clicking between objects
- Loading files with multiple CAD objects
- Any scenario involving control point updates during selection changes

The fix maintains all existing functionality while adding robust error handling and defensive programming practices.

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding more comprehensive logging for debugging
2. Monitor for any performance impact from additional checks
3. Consider adding unit tests for edge cases in control point handling
4. Review other potential race conditions in the graphics system
