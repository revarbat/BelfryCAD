# ImageTool Inheritance Fix

## Overview
Fixed a critical issue where the `ImageTool` class was not properly inheriting from the `Tool` base class, causing a `TypeError` during application startup.

## Problem
The error occurred when trying to instantiate the `ImageTool`:
```
TypeError: object.__init__() takes exactly one argument (the instance to initialize)
```

This happened because:
1. `ImageTool` was calling `super().__init__(document_window, document, preferences)`
2. But `ImageTool` was not inheriting from `Tool` (it was inheriting from `object`)
3. `object.__init__()` only accepts `self` as an argument

## Root Cause
The `ImageTool` class definition was missing the inheritance from the `Tool` base class:

**Before:**
```python
class ImageTool:
    """Tool for inserting images into the CAD document."""
    
    def __init__(self, document_window, document, preferences):
        super().__init__(document_window, document, preferences)  # ❌ Error
```

## Solution
Fixed the class definition to properly inherit from `Tool`:

**After:**
```python
from .base import Tool

class ImageTool(Tool):
    """Tool for inserting images into the CAD document."""
    
    def __init__(self, document_window, document, preferences):
        super().__init__(document_window, document, preferences)  # ✅ Correct
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Missing Import
```python
from .base import Tool
```

### 2. Fixed Class Inheritance
```python
class ImageTool(Tool):  # Now properly inherits from Tool
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ Successful Tests
- `ImageTool` import: SUCCESS
- `ImageTool` class definition: SUCCESS
- `DocumentWindow` import: SUCCESS
- No more `TypeError` during tool instantiation

## Impact
This fix resolves the application startup issue that was preventing the GUI from loading properly. The `ImageTool` can now be properly instantiated and registered with the tool manager.

## Verification
The inheritance chain is now correct:
- `ImageTool` → `Tool` → `QObject` → `object`

This allows the proper initialization sequence:
1. `ImageTool.__init__()` calls `super().__init__()`
2. `Tool.__init__()` calls `super().__init__()` (QObject)
3. `QObject.__init__()` initializes the Qt object
4. `Tool.__init__()` continues with tool-specific initialization
5. `ImageTool.__init__()` continues with image-specific initialization

## Conclusion
The `ImageTool` inheritance issue has been successfully resolved. The application can now start properly without the `TypeError` that was preventing tool instantiation.
