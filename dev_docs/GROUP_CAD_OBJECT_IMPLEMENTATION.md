# GroupCadObject Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the `GroupCadObject` class and the tree structure for grouping CAD objects in the BelfryCAD system.

## Key Features

### GroupCadObject Class

The `GroupCadObject` class extends `CadObject` and provides the following functionality:

- **Nested Grouping**: Groups can contain other groups, allowing for hierarchical organization
- **Object Management**: Groups can contain any type of CAD object (lines, circles, arcs, etc.)
- **Transformation**: Groups can be transformed (translated, scaled, rotated) and all children are affected
- **Bounds Calculation**: Groups calculate their bounds based on all visible children
- **Point Containment**: Groups can check if a point is contained within any of their children

### Document Tree Structure

The `Document` class has been enhanced to support a tree structure:

- **Object Dictionary**: Maintains the existing `object_id` to `CadObject` dictionary for fast lookups
- **Root Groups**: Tracks root-level groups in a separate set for efficient access
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Each object can have a parent group and groups can have multiple children
- **Hierarchy Management**: Provides methods to add/remove objects from groups and manage the tree structure

## Implementation Details

### GroupCadObject Methods

- `add_child(child_id)`: Add a child object to the group
- `remove_child(child_id)`: Remove a child object from the group
- `get_children()`: Get list of child object IDs
- `set_parent(parent_id)`: Set the parent group ID
- `get_parent()`: Get the parent group ID
- `is_root()`: Check if this group is a root group
- `get_bounds()`: Calculate bounds from all visible children
- `translate(dx, dy)`: Translate all children by the specified offset
- `scale(scale, center)`: Scale all children around the center point
- `rotate(angle, center)`: Rotate all children around the center point
- `transform(transform)`: Transform all children using the given transform
- `contains_point(point, tolerance)`: Check if any child contains the given point
- `get_all_descendants()`: Get all descendant object IDs (recursive)
- `get_visible_children()`: Get list of visible child object IDs

### Document Methods

- `create_group(name)`: Create a new group
- `add_to_group(object_id, group_id)`: Add an object to a group
- `remove_from_group(object_id)`: Remove an object from its group (move to root)
- `get_root_objects()`: Get all root objects (objects not in any group)
- `get_root_groups()`: Get all root groups
- `get_group_hierarchy()`: Get the complete group hierarchy as a dictionary
- `get_object_path(object_id)`: Get the path from root to the object

## Usage Examples

### Creating Groups

```python
# Create a new group
group_id = document.create_group("My Group")

# Add objects to the group
document.add_to_group(line_id, group_id)
document.add_to_group(circle_id, group_id)
```

### Nested Groups

```python
# Create parent and child groups
parent_group_id = document.create_group("Parent Group")
child_group_id = document.create_group("Child Group")

# Add child group to parent group
document.add_to_group(child_group_id, parent_group_id)

# Add objects to child group
document.add_to_group(line_id, child_group_id)
```

### Group Transformations

```python
# Get the group object
group = document.get_object(group_id)

# Transform the entire group
group.translate(10, 5)
group.scale(2.0, Point2D(0, 0))
group.rotate(math.pi/4, Point2D(0, 0))
```

### Removing Objects from Groups

```python
# Remove an object from its group (moves to root)
document.remove_from_group(object_id)

# Delete a group (children are moved to parent or root)
document.remove_object(group_id)
```

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility:

- All existing CAD objects continue to work without modification
- The `parent_id` attribute is optional and defaults to `None`
- Objects without a parent are considered root objects
- The existing object dictionary lookup is preserved for performance

## Testing

Comprehensive tests have been created in `tests/test_group_cad_object.py` covering:

- Group creation and basic functionality
- Adding objects to groups
- Nested group hierarchies
- Removing objects from groups
- Group bounds calculation
- Group transformations
- Deleting groups with children

All tests pass successfully.

## Example Output

The example script `examples/group_cad_object_example.py` demonstrates:

1. Creating basic shapes (lines, circles)
2. Creating groups and adding objects to them
3. Nesting groups (groups within groups)
4. Displaying the hierarchy
5. Testing group bounds and transformations
6. Removing objects from groups
7. Deleting groups with children

The example shows that the grouping system works correctly with proper parent-child relationship management and transformation propagation.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements could include:

- Group visibility controls (show/hide entire groups)
- Group locking (prevent modifications to group contents)
- Group selection (select all objects in a group)
- Group serialization/deserialization
- Group undo/redo support
- Group-specific constraints
