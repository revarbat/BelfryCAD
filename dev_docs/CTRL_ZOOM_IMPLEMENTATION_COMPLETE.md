# Ctrl+Mousewheel Zoom Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented Ctrl+mousewheel zooming functionality in the CADGraphicsView class. This feature provides intuitive zoom control that integrates seamlessly with existing scroll functionality.

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes
**File Modified:** `/BelfryCAD/gui/cad_graphics_view.py`

The `wheelEvent()` method was enhanced to detect Ctrl+mousewheel combinations and implement zoom functionality:

```python
def wheelEvent(self, event):
    """Handle mouse wheel events for scrolling and zooming"""
    from PySide6.QtCore import Qt

    # Get wheel delta values
    delta = event.angleDelta()

    # Check for Ctrl+wheel for zooming
    if event.modifiers() & Qt.KeyboardModifier.ControlModifier:
        # Zoom functionality with Ctrl+wheel
        if self.drawing_manager and self.drawing_manager.cad_scene:
            # Get current scale factor
            current_scale = self.drawing_manager.cad_scene.scale_factor
            
            # Calculate zoom factor (normalize wheel delta)
            zoom_delta = delta.y() / 120.0  # Standard wheel delta is 120
            zoom_factor = 1.0 + (zoom_delta * 0.1)  # 10% zoom step
            
            # Calculate new scale factor
            new_scale = current_scale * zoom_factor
            
            # Clamp zoom to reasonable limits (0.01x to 100x)
            new_scale = max(0.01, min(100.0, new_scale))
            
            # Apply the new scale factor
            self.drawing_manager.cad_scene.set_scale_factor(new_scale)
        
        # Accept the event to prevent further processing
        event.accept()
        return

    # ...existing scroll functionality preserved...
```

### Key Features

1. **Ctrl+Wheel Detection**
   - Uses `Qt.KeyboardModifier.ControlModifier` to detect Ctrl key
   - Only triggers zoom when Ctrl is held during wheel events

2. **Zoom Sensitivity**
   - 10% zoom step per wheel notch
   - Wheel delta normalized to standard 120 units
   - Smooth and predictable zoom behavior

3. **Zoom Limits**
   - Minimum zoom: 0.01x (1% of original size)
   - Maximum zoom: 100x (10,000% of original size)
   - Prevents extreme zoom levels that could cause issues

4. **Integration**
   - Uses existing `CadScene.set_scale_factor()` method
   - Maintains all grid, ruler, and UI updates
   - Preserves all existing scroll functionality

5. **Compatibility**
   - Does not interfere with normal wheel scrolling
   - Preserves Shift+wheel horizontal scrolling
   - Maintains multitouch scrolling functionality

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
**File:** `/tests/test_ctrl_zoom.py`

The test suite validates:

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Ctrl+wheel up zooms in (increases scale factor)
   - Ctrl+wheel down zooms out (decreases scale factor)
   - Normal wheel events don't trigger zoom

2. **Zoom Calculations**
   - Correct 10% zoom steps
   - Proper zoom factor calculations
   - Expected scale factor results

3. **Zoom Limits**
   - Minimum zoom limit enforcement (0.01x)
   - Maximum zoom limit enforcement (100x)
   - Proper clamping behavior

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Other modifier keys don't trigger zoom
   - Existing functionality preserved
   - All methods and attributes present

### Test Results
```
✓ Wheel event handler exists
✓ Normal wheel scrolling does not trigger zoom
✓ Ctrl+wheel zoom in works correctly
✓ Ctrl+wheel zoom out works correctly
✓ Minimum zoom limit works correctly
✓ Maximum zoom limit works correctly
✓ Shift+wheel does not trigger zoom (horizontal scroll preserved)
✓ All expected methods are present
✓ Touch events still enabled
```

## User Experience

### Controls
- **Ctrl + Mouse Wheel Up**: Zoom in (10% increase per step)
- **Ctrl + Mouse Wheel Down**: Zoom out (10% decrease per step)
- **Mouse Wheel**: Normal vertical scrolling (unchanged)
- **Shift + Mouse Wheel**: Horizontal scrolling (unchanged)
- **Two-finger touch**: Multitouch scrolling (unchanged)

### Behavior
- Smooth, responsive zooming
- Consistent 10% zoom steps
- Reasonable zoom limits prevent extreme scaling
- Visual feedback through grid and ruler updates
- No conflicts with existing scroll operations

## Technical Architecture

### Connection Path
```
CADGraphicsView.wheelEvent()
    ↓
DrawingManager.cad_scene
    ↓
CadScene.set_scale_factor()
    ↓
Grid redraw, ruler updates, scale change signals
```

### Event Flow
1. User performs Ctrl+mousewheel
2. `wheelEvent()` detects Ctrl modifier
3. Current scale factor retrieved from CadScene
4. Zoom delta calculated from wheel movement
5. New scale factor computed and clamped
6. `CadScene.set_scale_factor()` called
7. UI components update automatically
8. Event accepted to prevent further processing

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains 100% backward compatibility:

- **Existing scroll behavior**: Unchanged
- **Multitouch functionality**: Preserved
- **Horizontal scrolling**: Still works with Shift+wheel
- **API compatibility**: No changes to public interfaces
- **Event handling**: Proper event acceptance prevents conflicts

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Zoom-to-cursor (zoom centered on mouse position)
- Configurable zoom sensitivity
- Zoom history/undo functionality
- Keyboard zoom shortcuts (Ctrl++, Ctrl+-)
- Smooth zoom animation

## Summary

The Ctrl+mousewheel zoom implementation is now complete and fully functional. It provides intuitive zoom control that CAD users expect while maintaining seamless integration with all existing functionality. The feature has been thoroughly tested and documented for maintainability.
