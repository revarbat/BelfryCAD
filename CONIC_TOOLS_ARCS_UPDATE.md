# CONIC Tools Category Movement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the movement of CONIC2PT and CONIC3PT tools from the ELLIPSES category to the ARCS category in the pyTkCAD application.

## Changes Made

### Tool Categorization
**MOVED FROM ELLIPSES TO ARCS:**
- CONIC2PT (Conic 2 Point) - Shortcut: '2'
- CONIC3PT (Conic 3 Point) - Shortcut: 'I'

### Code Changes

#### File: `src/gui/tool_palette.py`
**ARCS Category (ToolCategory.ARCS):**
- ✅ CONIC2PT: '2' (already present)
- ✅ CONIC3PT: 'I' (already present)

**ELLIPSES Category (ToolCategory.ELLIPSES):**
- ❌ REMOVED: CONIC2PT: 'O' 
- ❌ REMOVED: CONIC3PT: 'I'

### Updated Tool Categories

#### Arc Tools (A + secondary key)
Now includes 5 tools total:
- C - Arc by Center (ARCCTR)
- 3 - Arc by 3 Points (ARC3PT)
- T - Arc by Tangent (ARCTAN)
- **2 - Conic 2 Point (CONIC2PT)** ← MOVED HERE
- **I - Conic 3 Point (CONIC3PT)** ← MOVED HERE

#### Ellipse Tools (E + secondary key)
Now includes 8 tools total:
- C - Circle (CIRCLE)
- 2 - Circle by 2 Points (CIRCLE2PT)
- 3 - Circle by 3 Points (CIRCLE3PT)
- E - Ellipse Center (ELLIPSECTR)
- D - Ellipse Diagonal (ELLIPSEDIAG)
- O - Ellipse 3 Corner (ELLIPSE3COR)
- T - Ellipse Center Tangent (ELLIPSECTAN)
- G - Ellipse Opposite Tangent (ELLIPSEOPTAN)

## Rationale
CONIC tools were moved to the ARCS category because:
1. **Mathematical Relationship**: Conic sections include arcs as special cases
2. **Functional Similarity**: CONIC tools create curved geometry similar to arc tools
3. **Logical Grouping**: Better organization of curve-related tools together
4. **User Expectation**: Users looking for curve tools would naturally check the ARCS category

## Testing

### Verification Test: `test_conic_tools_arcs.py`
Created comprehensive test to verify:
- ✅ CONIC2PT has shortcut '2' in ARCS category
- ✅ CONIC3PT has shortcut 'I' in ARCS category  
- ✅ CONIC tools are NOT present in ELLIPSES category
- ✅ No conflicts with existing shortcuts

### Application Testing
- ✅ Application starts successfully: `python main.py --test-shortcuts`
- ✅ All keyboard shortcuts function correctly
- ✅ Tool palettes display correct tools in each category

## Documentation Updates

### Files Updated:
- ✅ `KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md` - Updated Arc and Ellipse tool listings
- ✅ `CONIC_TOOLS_ARCS_UPDATE.md` - This summary document

### Key Changes:
- Arc Tools section now lists 5 tools (was 3)
- Ellipse Tools section now lists 8 tools (was 10)
- CONIC tools moved from Ellipse to Arc category listings

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

The CONIC tools have been successfully moved from the ELLIPSES category to the ARCS category with:
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Maintained shortcut consistency ('2' for 2-point, 'I' for 3-point conic)
- Comprehensive testing and verification
- Complete documentation updates
