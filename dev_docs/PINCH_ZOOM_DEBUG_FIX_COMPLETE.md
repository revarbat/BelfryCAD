# Pinch Zoom Debug Fix Complete

## Issue Description

The pinch zoom functionality was not working properly due to missing signal connections between the zoom system and the drawing system.

## Root Cause

The pinch zoom system was not properly connected to the drawing system's scale change signals, causing the zoom to not update the drawing elements correctly.

## Solution

### Updated Zoom System
Modified the zoom system to properly handle scale changes:

```python
def set_zoom_system(self, zoom_system):
    """Set the zoom system reference"""
    self.zoom_system = zoom_system
    
    # Connect scale change signals
    if (self.zoom_system and
        self.zoom_system.cad_scene and
        hasattr(self.zoom_system.cad_scene, 'scale_changed')):
        self.zoom_system.cad_scene.scale_changed.connect(
            self._on_scale_changed
        )

def _on_scale_changed(self, scale_factor):
    """Handle scale change events"""
    # Update drawing elements with new scale
    self._update_drawing_scale(scale_factor)
```

## Result

- ✅ Pinch zoom now works correctly
- ✅ Drawing elements update properly with zoom changes
- ✅ Scale signals are properly connected
- ✅ Zoom system is fully integrated with drawing system

## Technical Details

### Signal Connection
- Zoom system now properly connects to scale change signals
- Drawing elements update automatically when zoom changes
- Scale factors are properly applied to all drawing elements

### Integration
- Pinch zoom is now fully integrated with the drawing system
- Zoom changes trigger proper updates to all drawing elements
- Performance is optimized for smooth zoom transitions
