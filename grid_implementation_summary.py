print("=== PyTkCAD Grid Implementation Summary ===")
print()
print("✅ COMPLETED FEATURES:")
print("1. Dotted grid lines aligned with ruler major tickmarks")
print("2. Grid spacing: 5 units (majorspacing * 5) for optimal visibility")
print("3. Light gray dotted lines (RGB: 200,200,200) behind other elements")
print("4. Grid lines at z-value -1001 (behind axis lines at -1000)")
print("5. Grid updates when scrolling/panning the canvas")
print("6. Grid redraws when scene changes")
print()
print("✅ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:")
print("- Added _add_grid_lines() method to MainWindow class")
print("- Added _redraw_grid() method for dynamic updates")
print("- Modified _update_rulers_and_grid() to refresh grid on view changes")
print("- Grid extraction from ruler system's get_grid_info() method")
print("- Proper coordinate calculation using math.floor() for alignment")
print()
print("✅ INTEGRATION POINTS:")
print("- Grid called in _create_canvas() after axis lines")
print("- Grid redrawn in draw_objects() to maintain after scene clear")
print("- Grid updates connected to scroll bar changes")
print("- Grid updates connected to scene rectangle changes")
print()
print("✅ VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS:")
print("- Dotted line style (Qt.DotLine)")
print("- 1-pixel line width")
print("- Light gray color for subtle background presence")
print("- Lines every 5 coordinate units")
print("- Covers entire scene rectangle")
print()
print("✅ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:")
print("- Efficient grid removal using z-value filtering")
print("- Grid only drawn within visible scene bounds")
print("- Reasonable spacing (5 units) prevents visual clutter")
print()
print("The grid functionality has been successfully implemented and integrated")
print("into the PyTkCAD main window, providing visual alignment guides that")
print("correspond to the ruler major tickmarks.")
print()
print("To test: Run 'python main.py' and observe the dotted grid lines in the")
print("drawing canvas that align with the ruler markings.")
