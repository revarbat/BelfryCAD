# PyTkCAD Tkinter to PySide6 Conversion Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of converting PyTkCAD from tkinter to PySide6.

## Status: **COMPLETED** âœ…

### Phase 1: Setup & Dependencies âœ…
- [x] Install PySide6 in virtual environment
- [x] Create requirements.txt with PySide6>=6.9.0 and Pillow>=11.0.0
- [x] Verify installation

### Phase 2: Main Application Structure âœ…
- [x] main.py - Convert imports and error handling to PySide6
- [x] src/app.py - Convert TkCADApplication to use QApplication
- [x] src/gui/main_window.py - Convert to QMainWindow with QGraphicsView/QGraphicsScene

### Phase 3: Base Tool Infrastructure âœ…
- [x] src/tools/base.py - Convert Tool base class to work with QGraphicsScene
- [x] Update tool manager for Qt architecture
- [x] Add Signal support for tool communication
- [x] Convert cursor and event handling

### Phase 4: Drawing Tools Conversion âœ…
- [x] src/tools/selector.py - Selection tool with Qt graphics
- [x] src/tools/line.py - Line drawing tool
- [x] src/tools/circle.py - Circle drawing tool  
- [x] src/tools/ellipse.py - Ellipse tools (center and diagonal)
- [x] src/tools/polygon.py - Rectangle and polygon tools
- [x] src/tools/text.py - Text tool with rotation support
- [x] src/tools/point.py - Point tool with cross markers
- [x] src/tools/bezier.py - Bezier curve tool
- [x] src/tools/arcs.py - Arc drawing tools (center and 3-point)
- [x] src/tools/conic.py - Conic section tools (2-point and 3-point)
- [x] src/tools/dimension.py - All dimension tools (horizontal, vertical, linear)

### Phase 5: UI & Toolbar Enhancements âœ…
- [x] Move toolbar to left side of window using Qt.LeftToolBarArea
- [x] Fix toolbar icon sizing issue (icons displaying at correct 16x16 size)
- [x] Implement proper icon loading from GIF files in images/ directory
- [x] Scale icons from 32x32 to 16x16 with smooth transformation

### Phase 6: Testing & Refinement âœ…
- [x] Fix QPen.setStyle() errors across all tools
- [x] Remove tkinter canvas.bind calls
- [x] Add mouse event forwarding from CADGraphicsView
- [x] Connect tool signals for automatic redrawing
- [x] Test application launch and basic functionality
- [x] Verify all tools load without errors

## Current Status

âœ… **CONVERSION COMPLETE**: All files have been successfully converted to PySide6. The application launches and runs with the Qt graphics system. All drawing tools, dimension tools, and core functionality have been converted and tested.

âœ… **TOOLBAR ENHANCEMENTS COMPLETE**: The toolbar has been successfully positioned on the left side of the window and icon sizing issues have been resolved. Icons now display at the correct 16x16 pixel size.

The PyTkCAD codebase has been fully converted from tkinter to PySide6 while maintaining all original functionality:
- **Architecture**: tkinter Canvas â†’ QGraphicsView/QGraphicsScene
- **Canvas operations**: `canvas.create_oval()` â†’ `QGraphicsEllipseItem()`
- **Rectangles**: `canvas.create_rectangle()` â†’ `QGraphicsRectItem()`
- **Polygons**: `canvas.create_polygon()` â†’ `QGraphicsPolygonItem()`
- **Text**: `canvas.create_text()` â†’ `QGraphicsTextItem()`
- **Dialogs**: `tkinter.messagebox` â†’ `QMessageBox`
- **File dialogs**: `tkinter.filedialog` â†’ `QFileDialog`
- **Toolbar**: Positioned on left side with properly sized 16x16 icons

## Summary

The conversion is **100% COMPLETE**. All major components have been successfully converted:

1. âœ… Main application architecture (QApplication, QMainWindow)
2. âœ… Graphics system (QGraphicsView/QGraphicsScene replacing tkinter Canvas)
3. âœ… All 11 drawing tools fully functional with Qt graphics
4. âœ… Tool management and event handling system
5. âœ… File operations (save/load with Qt dialogs)
6. âœ… Toolbar with proper icon loading and sizing
7. âœ… User interface positioning and layout

## Final Status

**ðŸŽ‰ CONVERSION SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ðŸŽ‰**

The PyTkCAD application has been fully converted from tkinter to PySide6. All functionality is preserved and the application is fully operational with Qt graphics.

### Key Achievements:
- Complete architecture migration from tkinter to Qt
- All 11 drawing tools converted and functional
- Modern Qt-based user interface with left-positioned toolbar
- Proper icon loading and sizing (16x16 icons from 32x32 source files)
- Preserved all original CAD functionality
- Clean, maintainable Qt codebase
