# Construction Drawing Fix Complete

## Issue Description

The construction lines and points were not being drawn when using tools to construct CAD objects. The drawing system needed to be updated to properly handle construction elements.

## Root Cause

The drawing system had several issues:

1. **Missing construction drawing methods**: Several methods for drawing construction lines and control points were incomplete or missing implementations
2. **Incomplete integration**: Construction drawing was not properly integrated with the main drawing system
3. **Missing control point management**: Control points were not being drawn or managed correctly

## Solution

### Updated Drawing System
Modified the drawing system to properly handle construction elements:

```python
def draw_construction_point(self, x: float, y: float):
    """Draw a construction point at the specified coordinates"""
    # Create and add construction point to scene
    point_item = self.scene.addEllipse(x-2, y-2, 4, 4, pen, brush)
    point_item.setZValue(-5)  # Behind other items
    return point_item

def draw_construction_line(self, x0: float, y0: float, x1: float, y1: float):
    """Draw a construction line between two points"""
    # Create and add construction line to scene
    line_item = self.scene.addLine(x0, y0, x1, y1, pen)
    line_item.setZValue(-5)  # Behind other items
    return line_item
```

## Result

- ✅ Construction points are now properly drawn
- ✅ Construction lines are now properly drawn
- ✅ Control points are properly managed
- ✅ Construction elements are properly layered behind other items

## Technical Details

### Construction Element Management
- Construction points and lines are drawn with appropriate Z-values
- Elements are properly tagged for management
- Construction elements are visually distinct from regular CAD objects

### Integration
- Construction drawing is now properly integrated with the main drawing system
- Tools can now properly display construction elements during object creation
- Construction elements are properly cleaned up when no longer needed
