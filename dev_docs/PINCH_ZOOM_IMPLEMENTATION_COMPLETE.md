# Pinch-to-Zoom Implementation Complete

## Overview

Two-finger pinch and spread gestures have been successfully implemented for zooming in the CADGraphicsView class. This feature builds upon the existing multitouch scrolling infrastructure and integrates seamlessly with the current Ctrl+mouse wheel zoom functionality.

## Implementation Details

### Core Changes

#### CADGraphicsView Class (`BelfryCAD/gui/cad_graphics_view.py`)

1. **Touch Event Handling Enhancement**
   - Extended `event()` method to handle `TouchBegin`, `TouchUpdate`, and `TouchEnd` events
   - Added `_last_pinch_distance` state tracking for gesture lifecycle management

2. **Pinch Gesture Detection**
   - Modified `_handle_two_finger_scroll()` method to detect both pan and pinch gestures
   - Calculates distance between two touch points using Euclidean distance
   - Tracks distance changes to distinguish between pinch (zoom out) and spread (zoom in)

3. **Zoom Integration**
   - Uses existing `CadScene.set_scale_factor()` method for zoom operations
   - Maintains same zoom limits as Ctrl+wheel zoom (0.01x to 100x)
   - Configurable zoom sensitivity (default: 0.005)

4. **Gesture Lifecycle Management**
   - Initializes pinch distance tracking on first touch update
   - Resets tracking state on touch end to prevent gesture carry-over
   - Minimum distance threshold (5 pixels) to prevent accidental zoom during minor finger movements

### Key Features

#### Pinch-to-Zoom Behavior
- **Spread Gesture**: Moving fingers apart increases zoom (zoom in)
- **Pinch Gesture**: Moving fingers together decreases zoom (zoom out)
- **Sensitivity**: Configurable via `zoom_sensitivity` parameter (default: 0.005)
- **Thresholds**: Minimum 5-pixel distance change required to trigger zoom

#### Simultaneous Pan and Zoom
- Both panning and zooming can occur simultaneously during two-finger gestures
- Center point movement triggers panning (existing behavior)
- Distance changes trigger zooming (new behavior)
- Minimum movement thresholds prevent interference between gestures

#### Zoom Limits and Safety
- Same limits as existing zoom: 0.01x (1%) to 100x (10000%)
- Smooth zoom transitions without jarring jumps
- Consistent with Ctrl+mouse wheel zoom behavior

## Testing

### Automated Tests (`tests/test_pinch_zoom.py`)

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Pinch gesture detection (spread for zoom in, squeeze for zoom out)
- Zoom limit enforcement (min/max bounds)
- Sensitivity thresholds (prevents accidental zooming)
- Touch lifecycle management (proper state reset)
- Combined pinch and pan operations
- Integration with existing zoom infrastructure

All tests pass successfully.

### Manual Testing (`tests/manual_pinch_zoom_test.py`)

Interactive test application for touchscreen devices:
- Visual feedback showing current zoom level
- Test shapes for visual reference during zooming
- Instructions for proper gesture testing
- Real-time zoom percentage display in window title

## Usage Instructions

### For End Users
1. **Zoom In**: Place two fingers on the graphics view and spread them apart
2. **Zoom Out**: Place two fingers on the graphics view and pinch them together  
3. **Pan While Zooming**: Move the center point between your fingers to pan during zoom
4. **Traditional Zoom**: Ctrl+mouse wheel continues to work as before

### For Developers
The implementation extends existing touch handling without breaking changes:
- Existing multitouch scrolling continues to work
- All existing zoom functionality remains unchanged
- New pinch-to-zoom integrates through the same `CadScene.set_scale_factor()` method

## Technical Specifications

### Zoom Sensitivity Configuration
```python
zoom_sensitivity = 0.005  # Adjust in _handle_two_finger_scroll()
```

### Distance Threshold
```python
distance_threshold = 5.0  # Minimum pixels for zoom trigger
```

### Pan Movement Threshold  
```python
pan_threshold = 1.0  # Minimum pixels for pan trigger
```

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems Used
- `CadScene.set_scale_factor()` - Same method used by Ctrl+wheel zoom
- Existing touch event infrastructure from multitouch scrolling
- Standard Qt touch event handling (`QEvent.TouchBegin/Update/End`)

### State Management
- `_last_pinch_distance`: Tracks previous distance for delta calculations
- Reset on touch end to prevent gesture carry-over between touch sessions
- Initialized on first touch update for accurate distance tracking

## Compatibility

### Device Support
- Works on any touchscreen device supporting Qt touch events
- Tested with standard two-finger multitouch gestures
- Compatible with existing mouse and keyboard interactions

### Platform Support
- macOS: Full support with trackpad gestures
- Windows: Support via touchscreen devices
- Linux: Support via touchscreen devices with Qt touch event support

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Gesture Recognition**: Add support for more complex gestures
2. **Zoom Center**: Zoom around gesture center point instead of view center
3. **Momentum**: Add momentum-based zoom continuation
4. **Visual Feedback**: Show zoom level indicator during gesture

### Configuration Options
1. **Sensitivity Profiles**: Multiple sensitivity settings for different users
2. **Gesture Customization**: Allow users to configure gesture behavior
3. **Disable Options**: Toggle pinch-to-zoom on/off in preferences

## Conclusion

The pinch-to-zoom implementation successfully extends BelfryCAD's touch interaction capabilities while maintaining full compatibility with existing functionality. The feature provides intuitive zoom control for touchscreen users and integrates seamlessly with the existing CAD interface architecture.
